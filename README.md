<h3> Robert Konigsberg's Personal Website :smile:</h3>

This repository will be used to showcase the projects I have completed  
during my enrollment in MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding:  
**Full Stack Development with MERN program.** :sunglasses:

**Name:** Personal Website

**Description:** Here is my personal website, a Github page linked to other repositories of mine. Find personal, professional and academic information about my background. Additionally, my resume is included, along with my contact information. Check out my projects! 

**Roadmap for Future Improvements:** I plan to incorporate more sophisticated formatting (not just basic CSS for the most part). It would be nice to have the website divided into sections on the home page I can jump to. 

**Support:** Feel free to reach out at *konigsbergrobert@gmail.com*
